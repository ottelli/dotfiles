# dotfiles

Minimal and sensible configs I use on my two machines.

My main setup that I use for all my software development work is Ubuntu with AwesomeWM.
I have made a couple of themes for awesome and I like to tweak colour schemes so I tried to make this as easy as possible (just checkout .confg/awesome/settings.lua). Both take advantage of all the usual awesomewm stuff like workspace peeking, with intuitive keymaps for basic functions.

I'm also keeping an old laptop alive with Arch + XMonad that I use to play around with Linux and do generally tinkering. (Hence the 'Monad Clone' theme :sunglasses:)

Starship styles the terminal prompt in both setups, again I don't go crazy with it! Just minimal & sensible :ok_hand:
